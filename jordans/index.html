             Jordans started all after Michael Jordan, the goat of basketball. I started to collect shoes after my brother taught me, 
               because he gave me a bunch of tips, on how to tell if a sneaker is a rep
             I also like basketball which is why Jordans and basketball go together. </p><h3>
             <h2>facts about jordans</h2>
            <h3> Did you know that Peter Moore is the creator of Jordans? He's also worked for Adidas, anyway about Jordans. 
               Why were they created?
               Michael Jordan had a few problems with his shoes, with Jordan it helped him jump, and it helped him not feel the court. </h3>
