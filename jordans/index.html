             Jordans started all after Michael Jordan, the goat of basketball. I started to collect shoes after my brother taught me, 
               because he gave me a bunch of tips, or how to tell if a sneaker is a rep
             I also like basketball which is why jordans and basketball go together. </p><h3>
             <h2>facts about jordans</h2>
            <h3>did you know that peter moore is the creator of jordans? He's also worked for adidas, anyways about jordans. 
               Why were they created?
               Michael jordan had a few problems with his shoes, with jordans it helped him jump, it helped him not feel the court. </h3>
